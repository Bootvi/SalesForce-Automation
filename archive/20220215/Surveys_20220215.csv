We understand that empowering the customer is a good thing but forcing the customer to handle issues using complicated methods over a simple SQL query run by someone at ExLibris does not make sense.  If more direct and readily made tools for the customer would be available to allow mass changes and being able to replace a field with an already existing field this would have made this so much easier.

a2k3r000002BZ8mAAG,"The service I received was fine and the support staff I interacted with were very knowledgeable and polite. What I am dissatisfied about was that when we encountered an issue in the display of a bib record on Primo took almost 24 hours to resolve. Apparently in the changeover for the support portal my account was not configured properly and a technician had to refer me to Salesforce's support. Laura Guy was amazing and ended up being able to fix my account on her own which was above and beyond what her duties were and I greatly appreciated. The Proquest IT team took over 12 hours to respond after Laura had already fixed the issue herself. It was cumbersome to figure out how to get in touch with your company to get the problem resolved to begin with, and the original issue I needed support for was a very simple solution that was not readily searchable on your knowledge base (a couple records were grouped together and we didn't know that the Dedup and FRBR utility needed to be used). Now that my support account is properly configured it shouldn't be a problem, but it caused an issue that could have easily been answered right away to take over a day to get resolved.",2.0,2021-12-15T18:09:24.000+0000,06214597,2021-12-14T14:23:33.000+0000,Web - Authenticated,,01RINGLING,Lori Lareau,NA Primo Tier 1 Support Team,Alexandra Vargas-Fournier,Alexandra Vargas-Fournier

He was patient and encouraging and answered all of my questions in a way that was easy for a novice like me to understand.

a2k3r000002BhgTAAS,"Feedback from our fulfillment staff member ""We're not activating transit requests....we're activating temp holds, patrons, etc...they just happen to involve items being put into transit.

   The activate feature is used to prioritize all types of requests i.e. move them to the top of the queue.  An item may have 2 requests that involve two different locations.   Only being able to use that feature once it arrives at a request location seems illogical. Nor does the online documentation state that is the case (but maybe they presume the requests involve the same location).  Additionally, if I wait until an item arrives at the hold location(1st request) and then try activating the 2nd request...it still puts the item back on the 'pick from shelf' step.
  So, the only time you can use 'Activate' is if the item has yet to be pulled.

I don't understand the usefulness or purpose. And the online documentation is sparse as well. ""

Ultimately we decided this wasn't worth additional discussion as it's not necessary to our current workflows. We were just confused by the answer.

a2k3r000002BmBkAAK,"Well, I would say my response is neutral, rather than satisfied or dissatisfied.

We were pleased to finally get this done. But we were reassured before having the reporting codes deactivated that they would not leave the PO lines. And after the de-activation they DID get removed from the PO Lines. However, the reporting codes data is accessible in Alma Analytics. 

So I do not wish to say I am dissatisfied or satisfied. But it would have been better to be armed with the knowledge upfront of what the actual implications were. That is, the reporting codes are removed from the PO Lines.",2.0,2022-02-07T15:21:50.000+0000,05325460,2022-02-06T09:38:04.000+0000,Web - Authenticated,Alma,01UWI-WH,Katie Cheever,NA Alma Tier 2 Support Team,Jennifer Pierce,Carol Elsen
