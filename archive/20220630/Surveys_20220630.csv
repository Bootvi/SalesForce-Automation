a2k3r000002BTUwAAO,"After identifying the issue (thank you), the remediation of the issue was a bit of a climb due to using already available tools instead of simply asking to have an SQL command run on the back end of the system to update all patrons.  We understand that empowering the customer is a good thing but forcing the customer to handle issues using complicated methods over a simple SQL query run by someone at ExLibris does not make sense.  If more direct and readily made tools for the customer would be available to allow mass changes and being able to replace a field with an already existing field this would have made this so much easier.

a2k3r000002BZ8mAAG,"The service I received was fine and the support staff I interacted with were very knowledgeable and polite. What I am dissatisfied about was that when we encountered an issue in the display of a bib record on Primo took almost 24 hours to resolve. Apparently in the changeover for the support portal my account was not configured properly and a technician had to refer me to Salesforce's support. Laura Guy was amazing and ended up being able to fix my account on her own which was above and beyond what her duties were and I greatly appreciated. The Proquest IT team took over 12 hours to respond after Laura had already fixed the issue herself. It was cumbersome to figure out how to get in touch with your company to get the problem resolved to begin with, and the original issue I needed support for was a very simple solution that was not readily searchable on your knowledge base (a couple records were grouped together and we didn't know that the Dedup and FRBR utility needed to be used). Now that my support account is properly configured it shouldn't be a problem, but it caused an issue that could have easily been answered right away to take over a day to get resolved.",2.0,2021-12-15T18:09:24.000+0000,06214597,2021-12-14T14:23:33.000+0000,Web - Authenticated,,01RINGLING,Lori Lareau,NA Primo Tier 1 Support Team,Alexandra Vargas-Fournier,Alexandra Vargas-Fournier

a2k3r000002BhgTAAS,"Feedback from our fulfillment staff member ""We're not activating transit requests....we're activating temp holds, patrons, etc...they just happen to involve items being put into transit.

   The activate feature is used to prioritize all types of requests i.e. move them to the top of the queue.  An item may have 2 requests that involve two different locations.   Only being able to use that feature once it arrives at a request location seems illogical. Nor does the online documentation state that is the case (but maybe they presume the requests involve the same location).  Additionally, if I wait until an item arrives at the hold location(1st request) and then try activating the 2nd request...it still puts the item back on the 'pick from shelf' step.
  So, the only time you can use 'Activate' is if the item has yet to be pulled.

I don't understand the usefulness or purpose. And the online documentation is sparse as well. ""

Ultimately we decided this wasn't worth additional discussion as it's not necessary to our current workflows. We were just confused by the answer.

a2k3r000002BqpUAAS,"Aileen and her team were great. My only comment is that this took a long time to resolve--from the week of Jan 28 until February 17.  In the meantime the inaccuracies in our system were misleading staff and patrons. Each step for clarification in the ticket took 2-3 days, so even though the actual fix did not take long, the resolution was very drawn out.

a2k3r000002BsUEAA0,I am dissatisfied but this is not Sayed's fault- he was courteous and did what he could yesterday to try to resolve the problem.  This has been folded into case 06040904 which has been open since the Support Portal migration in November. The 3 George Washington University library accounts had cases badly mis-assigned and things are still not right.  Right now it is the worst it's been for us at Himmelfarb as we can't use the Support Portal to open cases.,2.0,2022-02-25T16:35:28.000+0000,06290758,2022-02-24T16:08:58.000+0000,Chat - Authenticated,,01WRLC-GWAHLTH,Aileen Nolan,NA Alma Tier 1 Support Team,Automated Process,JoLinda Thompson

a2k3r000002BvEsAAK,"The support analyst gave me a very clear answer as to what they knew and why they didn't know what they didn't know. But the fact that something that is considered an enhancement ""is handled internally by our Developers and no updates are made available to Support"" seems a little odd. Communication to support is important, especially internally. These are your frontline people.

a2k3r000002C3HpAAK,"I do not care for the new ticket system.  I feel as though the high level of Very Satisfactory customer service has greatly declined since the implementation of your new system.  I also feel that since the ""new"" portal for customer service / tickets has been launched that the replies from support are slower and feel/sound (read) to be scripted and the ""scripted"" sounding answers do not have the steps to follow to fix the problem.  For example: if I need to go to Configuration &gt; Fulfillment &gt; Category A &gt; Category B (or whichever), those important steps are missing.  I understand I am an Alma/PrimoVE certified administrator, however, Alma is much bigger than our previous ILS and I cannot always remember the steps/locations for everything.  On a positive note, using google.com and typing site:alma ex libris [problem] I am finding the solution much easier (most of the time) than I did with Voyager. 

TL/DR: Since the launch of the new support portal I feel that response times have doubled (at least); the answers feel too scripted; support responses/solutions do not always (most of the time) include the steps of where to go to make change (i.e. to modify Terms of Use or an item policy); support is not near as responsive as they used to be; however on a positive note, google.com searching site:alma [problem] is better with Alma than it is with Voyager.

P.S. Yaala has helped me a few times and is always a pleasure to speak to; she is very pleasant and very knowledgeable.  

P.S.S. I miss Laura G. and wish she was on the Alma team, however, I know she is a pro with Voyager and as much as I wish she was with Alma support I would not want to deprive the Voyager part of our ExLibris family of her knowledge and kindness.",3.0,2022-03-30T18:36:40.000+0000,06250341,2022-03-15T18:00:33.000+0000,Web - Authenticated,,01RESEMINRY,Holly Pletka,NA Alma Tier 1 Support Team,Vic Broberg,Vic Broberg

a2k3r000002C6VVAA0,"I am satisfied with the resolution of the case, but I am disappointed in the initial responsiveness of the help team. I set the case importance with medium priority, and I heard in the very beginning that the case was assigned to someone (Trey, I believe?). After that, I didn't hear anything for over two weeks, even after I left two additional comments on the case to see how it was going. I had to escalate the case in order to get a response after that two weeks, and then I heard from someone named Lori right away. I am wondering if I just need to set all cases as 'high priority' in order to get faster response times, but I don't feel like that would be the best approach. Not everything is an emergency, of course, and I hate to set a high priority when I don't need an immediate response. I would expect that on a medium priority case, I would get a status update or something in less than two weeks, though. Ex Libris/Proquest needs to make it clearer what kind of response times they can give for the different priorities (low, medium, high).

a2k3r000002C7IDAA0,Both Aileen and Emily did stay on top of this and did their best to work towards a resolution. The reason I'm giving a dissatisfied is the level of dysfunction we experienced with the Support Portal and the length of time it took to get this all resolved.  The migration happened in November and things were not right for months.  I spent literally hours pulling together lists of cases to identify them as ours or belonging to another GW library for cleanup. One reason this was so difficult is that I could not output cases to a friendly format for sorting and copying.

Ebscohost's tech support said it was a problem at Ex Libris' end. In the end, the problem was solved by another librarian at one of our state libraries, and it was because the Ebsco collection services needed to have an OPID added. Someone at either Ex Libris or Ebscohost should have known this. Then, this morning, libraries who hadn't had time to add the OPID noticed that their connections to Ebscohost articles suddenly worked. We never found out why.

Overall, I've been a bit frustrated that every chat no matter how simple it seems, turns into a case that then takes forever to be resolved. If it's an issue of lack of knowledge, then those answering chats need more training. If it's an issue of not enough chat support and you're limiting the time of chat support to answer questions (which I'm more inclined to believe is the case given all of ExL's acquisitions), then you need to hire more people.

Once ticket sent to Tier 2, someone actually was able to help.  But I do not think it should take 4 weeks to resolve.  This was not a complex issue at all.  And I should not have to hound someone for a status update before action is finally taken.  Once someone actually worked on the ticket, it was fine.  I just feel that the turn-around time for resolution is too long - - and this is for all tickets.

a2k3r000002CMxuAAG,"This case was a mixed bag, and first off, I want to thank Jack Boettecher for getting to the bottom of our issue.  Essentially, there is a known issue with consortial collections, where the Ex Libris metadata librarians are not alerted to the presence of new content, when that content is uploaded by a consortia.  As a result, we have lost access to content for over a year in some instances because the files were not uploaded on Ex Libris' side.  This should be addressed by the vendor, not the customer, and as customers, we should not have to submit multiple error tickets to ensure that staff process these collections correctly.  In this particular case, I worked with Jack and the team at OhioLINK to update the consortial workflow, essentially asking their team to do double work and submit tickets that would explicitly alert the Ex Libris metadata team there was new content to upload.  While I appreciate Jack's troubleshooting immensely, this wasted both his time and mine -- the issue should have been addressed internally before it became such a widespread problem.",3.0,2022-06-09T13:46:32.000+0000,06357136,2022-06-06T21:43:13.000+0000,Web - Authenticated,,01OHI-DUL,Jack Boettcher,NA WFS Support Team,Sarah Schaff,Sarah Schaff

a2k3r000002CPPHAA4,"Except for the very short and direct answers I have received for the last couple of cases (things they could not be done because Alma cannot do them and it was suggested I submit the ideas to ELUNA/NERS)(change the font of the MDE to have a serif font and make the ""local"" bib 037 field searchable like the 035 (OCoLC), 945, 950 etc fields are)) I have not really been happy with Alma's support. 

The lost item case answers were confusing to me.  I asked what I thought was a very direct question and I received an over explanation that went the long way around reiterating what I asked. 

The case in question was: 

When does our Alma decide something is ""lost?""  I had a case a while back where Alma was not charging the lost item replacement fee.  However, Alma sent a notification to a patron (barcode 2025001) that the four books he has checked out will be deemed lost if not returned soon.  The original due date on them is 29 April 2022.  

Alma should be set to send overdue notifications day due (or day after); 7 days alter; 14 days later; 21 days later; 30 days later; 45 days later, then at 60 days the item is considered ""lost.""  This did work for patron (barcode 2021003).  Alma has not assessed fines to patron barcode 2025001 though.  It does seem that the wording has been altered/changed in the emails since the case I opened about it not assessing the lost item replacement fee from the item record.  It does look like some of the overdue notification have included the lost item processing fee in the past.  Maybe I am reading it incorrectly.  

Is there a way to prevent the lost item processing and lost item replacement fees from showing up on the overdue emails until the item is actually due or is this Alma's gentle way of telling patrons how much the fines could cost if the item is determined to be lost as opposed to just having an overdue fine?

The gist of the case was: 

When does our Alma decide something is ""lost?""  I had a case a while back where Alma was not charging the lost item replacement fee.  However, Alma sent a notification to a patron (barcode 2025001) that the four books he has checked out will be deemed lost if not returned soon...
Is there a way to prevent the lost item processing and lost item replacement fees from showing up on the overdue emails until the item is actually due or is this Alma's gentle way of telling patrons how much the fines could cost if the item is determined to be lost as opposed to just having an overdue fine? 

The answer was long. 

I did not need another explanation of the overdue lost/loan profile because there is a previous case in my history where an overdue lost/loan issue was fixed. 

In the middle of the answer was what I needed to know: 

...the fines we can see in that letter were not actually assessed since those items were not declared lost...

So yes, then the letter is showing the potential total fines/fees if the patron fails to return the items.  It IS Alma's way of gently nudging the patron to return the books. 

Overall, I am very dissatisfied with Alma's support team (except for the couple of times I called an Yaala (sp?) answered the phone and helped/directed me to help because she is very friendly (she had directed me to help before when we had Voyager) I really like Alma much more than Voyager and I am dissatisfied with this new support/ticket system it is bulky and confusing (but if we still had Voyager I would have to use it so I am stuck with it), but I am very satisfied with Alma.  

In the meantime I think I will resort to the Alma listserv and start opening tickets as a very last resort.  I wish your team was as good a Voyagers support.",1.0,2022-06-17T19:26:56.000+0000,06363765,2022-06-16T18:44:39.000+0000,Web - Authenticated,,01RESEMINRY,Aileen Nolan,NA Alma Tier 1 Support Team,Vic Broberg,Vic Broberg
